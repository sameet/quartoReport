## code to prepare `DATASET` dataset goes here
# WE only need some toy data to make sure that the part of this code works.
# We decided to use the data from GEO for this purpose.
# The data is simple and small enough and can potentially be bundled with the package.
# Right now it is difficult to extract the meta-data from the existing data.
